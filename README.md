# DizzyKit [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bjarkehs/DizzyKit.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bjarkehs/DizzyKit) [![CocoaPods Compatible](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/DizzyKit.svg)](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/DizzyKit.svg) [![Carthage Compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Carthage-compatible-4BC51D.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

Simple animation library that allows you to easily animate things.

This framework is heavily inspired by [Spruce](https://github.com/willowtreeapps/spruce-ios).
The reason I made this is because I needed a framework to do animations without having to put them in a container view first.

The framework attempts to be compatible with latest version of Swift.
Please check the Swift version matrix to see which version supports your Swift version.
The last verified version of Swift is 4.2 but it may still compile on later versions.
